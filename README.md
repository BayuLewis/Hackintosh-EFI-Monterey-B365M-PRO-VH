### Working
- Most Apple Apps
- Sleep
- USB Port
- Ethernet
- Etc...

### Not Working
- iMessage
- AirDrop (You need a bluetooth card for this)

### Notes
- Make sure to use GenSMBIOS to refill the UUID, System Serial Number,...
- For iMessage you can check [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html)
- For the GPU part, I would recommend you choose another Model because HIS is kinda sus and it's not functioning well on Windows (Linux is fine AFAIK)
- This config is for macOS 10.15 and above
- Make sure to do USB Mapping and replace the USBMap.kext before continue.
